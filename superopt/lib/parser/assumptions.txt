Z3 parser

1. For "ite" statements we assume that each statement will have all the input arguments specified, i.e. if arity is 3 then all 3 variables are assigned in the boolean expression.  

2. bool expression inside ite will either be set of assignments or a constant that evaluates to a bool expr. It cannot be a mixture of both.
